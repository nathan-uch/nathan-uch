                    <div class="w-3/4">I like searching for solutions through detailed observations and testing. Software engineering can sometimes feel like a great puzzle that makes time fly. The satisfaction of finding and coming up with a way to fix or improve makes the process so enjoyable. There are many paths to a solution!</div>
                    <div class="w-3/4">I enjoy movies, barbecue, snacking and gaming and have lived in 3 different continents</div>
