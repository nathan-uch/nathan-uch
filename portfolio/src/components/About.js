                <div class="w-3/4 mx-auto my-8 text-xl md:text-2x">I'm Nathan Huang, a web developer currently working with front-end. I enjoy creating websites and programming because the process has a great balance of creating and applying what you know versus learning and finding new methods of doing something.</div>
                <div class="w-3/4 mx-auto mb-8 text-xl md:text-2x">I like searching for improvements by being observant and paying attention to details, it can sometimes feel like a great puzzle making time fly. The satisfaction of finding and coming up with a way to fix or improve it makes the process so enjoyable since there's never a single way to do it.</div>
